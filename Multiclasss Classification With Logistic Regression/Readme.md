### Multiclass Classification with Logistic Regression on Raisin Dataset

### Overview
This project applies **Logistic Regression** to the **Raisin Dataset** to perform **multiclass classification**. Logistic regression is a foundational machine learning algorithm often used for classification tasks. While it is simple, it is powerful when paired with the right preprocessing steps, and it provides a strong baseline for more complex models.

The Raisin Dataset consists of two raisin types ("Kecimen" and "Besni"), characterized by **7 morphological features** extracted from images of raisins. Our goal is to predict the raisin type given these features.

## Dataset
The **Raisin Dataset** contains 900 samples with the following features:
- **Area** – Number of pixels within the raisin boundary.
- **Perimeter** – Length of the raisin boundary.
- **MajorAxisLength** – Length of the major axis of the ellipse equivalent to the raisin.
- **MinorAxisLength** – Length of the minor axis of the ellipse equivalent to the raisin.
- **Eccentricity** – Measure of how much the ellipse deviates from being circular.
- **ConvexArea** – Number of pixels in the convex hull of the raisin.
- **Extent** – Ratio of the raisin area to the bounding box area.
- **Class** – Raisin type: `Kecimen` or `Besni`.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load dataset using `pandas`.
   - Inspect data structure, class balance, and feature distributions.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Normalize features using `StandardScaler` for better model performance.

3. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).

4. **Model Training**
   - Use `LogisticRegression` from `scikit-learn` with `multinomial` option for multiclass classification.
   - Apply cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score on test set.
   - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Confusion matrix visualization.

6. **Visualization**
   - Feature distributions.
   - Confusion matrix heatmap for classification results.

## Code Explanation

### Importing Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
````

We import essential libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`), and machine learning (`scikit-learn`).

---

### Loading the Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_excel("Raisin_Dataset.xlsx")
print(df.head())
```

This step loads the dataset and displays the first rows to verify the structure.

---

### Feature Scaling

```python
X = df.drop("Class", axis=1)
y = df["Class"]

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the logistic regression model.

---

### Train-Test Split

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)
```

We use stratification to maintain class balance between training and testing sets.

---

### Model Training

```python
log_reg = LogisticRegression(multi_class="multinomial", solver="lbfgs", max_iter=1000)
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Here, logistic regression is trained with the multinomial setting, which allows handling multiple classes simultaneously.

---

### Evaluation

```python
y_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues", xticklabels=log_reg.classes_, yticklabels=log_reg.classes_)
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
```

We evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix visualizes misclassifications.

---

## Results

* Logistic Regression achieved high classification accuracy (>85%).
* Both raisin types were well separated in feature space.
* Misclassifications were minimal, showing logistic regression is a strong baseline for this dataset.

---

## Key Learnings

* Logistic Regression can be extended for multiclass classification using the **multinomial** approach.
* Feature scaling is crucial for algorithms that rely on distance or linear boundaries.
* Even simple models can perform competitively with good preprocessing.

---

## Future Work

* Try advanced models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Perform feature importance analysis.
* Deploy the model with a simple web interface.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to a real-world classification dataset. It highlights the end-to-end workflow from data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization — essential skills for any data scientist or machine learning engineer.
